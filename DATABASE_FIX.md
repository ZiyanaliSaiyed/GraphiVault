# Database Connection Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was crashing with:
```
thread 'main' panicked at src\main.rs:64:72:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Database(SqliteError { code: 14, message: "unable to open database file" })
```

## Root Cause
- SQLite error code 14 means "unable to open database file"
- This typically happens due to:
  1. Permissions issues
  2. Invalid file paths 
  3. Long path names on Windows
  4. Directory doesn't exist

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Error Handling
- Replaced all `.unwrap()` calls with proper error handling
- Added descriptive error messages for debugging
- Added detailed logging to track database initialization

### 2. Enhanced Database Path Management
- Changed from `vault/data/graphivault.db` to `vault/vault.db` (shorter path)
- Added write permission testing before database creation
- Proper Windows path separator handling (backslash to forward slash conversion)

### 3. Better SQLite Connection String
- Added `mode=rwc` to create database if it doesn't exist
- Removed unsupported parameters (`cache=shared`, `_fk=true`) that caused connection errors
- Foreign keys enabled via SQL PRAGMA in database initialization instead

### 4. Comprehensive Directory Setup
- Ensured all vault directories are created with proper permissions
- Added write test to verify directory accessibility
- Better error reporting for directory creation failures

### 5. Database Schema Initialization
- Automatically initialize database schema after connection
- Proper error handling for schema creation
- Verification of successful database setup

## Code Changes

### main.rs
```rust
// Before (problematic)
let pool = rt.block_on(SqlitePool::connect(&database_url)).unwrap();

// After (robust)
let pool = rt.block_on(SqlitePool::connect(&database_url))
    .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to connect to database: {}", e))?;

rt.block_on(crate::database::init_db(&pool))
    .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to initialize database: {}", e))?;
```

## Testing
- Added debug logging to verify paths and permissions
- Added write test to ensure directory is accessible
- Improved error messages for better debugging

## Expected Outcome
- Application should start without database panic
- Clear error messages if issues persist  
- Successful database connection and schema initialization
- Debug output showing exact paths and connection status
