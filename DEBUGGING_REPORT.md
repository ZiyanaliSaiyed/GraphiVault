# GraphiVault Image Upload Debug Report

## 1. CODE REVIEW & ANALYSIS

### Files Examined and Their Purposes:

#### Frontend Layer (Vue.js)
- **src/components/FileUpload.vue** - Main file upload component with drag/drop
- **src/utils/tauri.ts** - Tauri API wrapper for backend communication
- **src/utils/platform.ts** - Platform detection and API abstraction
- **src/stores/vault.ts** - Vault state management and image operations
- **src/views/DashboardView.vue** - Dashboard with upload functionality
- **src/views/VaultView.vue** - Main vault interface

#### Middleware Layer (Rust/Tauri)
- **src-tauri/src/commands.rs** - Tauri command handlers
- **src-tauri/src/main.rs** - Application entry point
- **src-tauri/src/database.rs** - Database operations
- **src-tauri/src/encryption.rs** - File encryption utilities

#### Backend Layer (Python)
- **python_backend/ipc/ipc_gateway.py** - Main IPC gateway
- **python_backend/core/core_engine.py** - Core vault operations
- **python_backend/crypto/crypto_controller.py** - Encryption controller
- **python_backend/storage/storage_interface.py** - Database interface
- **python_backend/ui/image_processor.py** - Image validation and processing

## 2. ISSUE INVESTIGATION

### Root Cause Analysis:
The encryption code appearing in terminal logs is actually **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR** - it represents the encrypted image data being transmitted securely. However, there are several issues preventing proper upload completion:

1. **Session Management**: Vault unlock state not properly maintained
2. **File Processing**: Missing image validation and thumbnail generation
3. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Inconsistent data models between layers
4. **Error Handling**: Poor error propagation and logging

### Specific Issues Found:

#### Issue 1: Database Schema Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Multiple conflicting ImageRecord definitions
- **Location**: `storage_interface.py` vs `database.rs`
- **Impact**: Upload fails during database storage

#### Issue 2: Missing Image Validation
- **Problem**: No proper image format validation before encryption
- **Location**: `image_processor.py` not integrated into upload flow
- **Impact**: Invalid files may be processed

#### Issue 3: Incomplete Upload Flow
- **Problem**: Upload stops after encryption, doesn't complete storage
- **Location**: `add_image` method in `core_engine.py`
- **Impact**: Images encrypted but not properly stored

## 3. DEBUGGING PROCESS

### Upload Flow Trace:
1. **Frontend**: FileUpload.vue → converts file to base64
2. **Tauri**: commands.rs → calls Python backend
3. **Python**: ipc_gateway.py → processes upload
4. **Core**: core_engine.py → encrypts and stores
5. **Storage**: storage_interface.py → database operations

### Error Points Identified:
- Base64 conversion working ✅
- Vault unlock status lost ❌
- Image validation skipped ❌
- Database storage incomplete ❌
